# WaveformDraw

Tool for experimenting with the shape/sound of waveforms.

## Getting Started

A (sometimes) working development build for Windows x64 is available in the [releases](https://github.com/wwilliamcook/WaveformDraw/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

## Requirements

Building requires Visual Studio (tested with Visual Studio Community 2019).

## Dependencies

* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
* [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/)

## Building

* Download [GLFW source code](https://www.glfw.org/download.html) and extract as `/Dependencies/GLFW`.
* Download [PortAudio stable release source code](http://files.portaudio.com/download.html) and extract as `/Dependencies/portaudio`.
* Build GLFW and PortAudio
* Compile with Visual Code

Good luck and sorry about no CMake support.
